By default, your EC2 machine comes with:
* A private IP for the internal AWS Network
* A public IP for the WWW

When you SSH into your EC2 machine:
* We can’t use a private IP, because we are not in the same network
* We can only use the public IP

If your machine is stopped and then restarted, the public IP will change

## EC2 User Data
* It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script
* Bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
* That script is only run once at the instance first start
* Purpose: Ec2 data is used to automated boot tasks such as:
    * Installing updates
    * Installing software
    * Downloading common files from the internet
* The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user
  
## EC2 Meta Data
* Information about your EC2 instance
* It allows EC2 isntances to "learn" about themselves without having to use an IAM role for that purpose
* Powerful but one of the least known features to developers
* You can retrieve IAM roles from the metadata but **not** IAM policies
* URL: {ec2-ip-address}/latest/meta-data

## EC2 Instance Launch Types 
- **On Demand Instances**: short workload, predictable pricing
- **Reserved Instances**: long workloads (>= 1 year)
- **Convertible Reserved Instances**: long workloads with flexible instances
- **Scheduled Reserved Instances**: launch within time window you reserve
- **Spot Instances**: short workloads, for cheap, can lose instances
- **Dedicated Instances**: no other customers will share your hardware
- **Dedicated Hosts**: book an entire physical server, control instance placement

#### On Demand Instance:
* Pay for what you use
* Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
* No long term commitment
* Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can’t predict how the application will behave
#### Reserved Instances
* Up to 75% compared to On-demand
* Pay upfront for what you use with long term commitment
* Reservation period can be 1 or 3 years
* Reserve a specific instance type
* Recommended for steady state usage applications (think database)
#### Convertible Reserved Instances
* Can change the EC2 instance type
* Up to 54% discount
#### Scheduled Reserved Instances
* Launch within time window you reserve
* When you require a fraction of a day / week / month
#### Spot Instances
* Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
* You bid a price and get the instance as long as its under the price
* Price varies based on offer and demand
* Spot instances are reclaimed within a 2 minute notification warning when the spot price goes above your bid
* Used for batch jobs, Big Data analysis, or workloads that are resilient to failures
* Not great for critical jobs or databases
#### Dedicated Instances
* Instances running on hardware that’s dedicated to you
* May share hardware with other instances in same account
* No control over instance placement (can move hardware after stop / start)
#### Dedicated Hosts
* Physical dedicated Ec2 server for your use
* Full control of Ec2 Instance placement
* Visibility into the underlying sockets / physical cores of the hardware
* Allocated for your account for a 3 year period reservation
* More expensive
* Useful for software that have a complicated licensing model (Bring your own License)
* Or for a companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs

#### Which host is right for me?
- On demand: coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the full price 
- Reserved: like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount. 
- Spot instances: the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms.You can get kicked out at any time 
- Dedicated Hosts: We book an entire building of the resort

## EC2 Pricing
- EC2 instances prices (per hour) varies based on these parameters:
  - Region you’re in
  - Instance Type you’re using
  - On-Demand vs Spot vs Reserved vs Dedicated Host
  - Linux vs Windows vs Private OS (RHEL, SLES, Windows SQL)
  - You are billed by the second, with a minimum of 60 seconds. 
  - You also pay for other factors such as storage, data transfer, fixed IP public addresses, load balancing
  - You do not pay for the instance if the instance is stopped 

- Example
  - t2.small in US-EAST-1 (VIRGINIA), cost $0.023 per Hour 
  - If used for:
    - 6 seconds, it costs $0.023/60 = $0.000383 (minimum of 60 seconds)
    - 60 seconds, it costs $0.023/60 = $0.000383 (minimum of 60 seconds)
    - 30 minutes, it costs $0.023/2 = $0.0115
    - 1 month, it costs $0.023 * 24 * 30 = $16.56 (assuming a month is 30 days)
    - X seconds (X > 60), it costs $0.023 * X / 3600 
  - The best way to know the pricing is to consult the pricing page: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/

## AMIs
### What's AMI?
- As we saw, AWS comes with base images such as:
  - Ubuntu
  - Fedora
  - RedHat
  - Windows
  - Etc...
- These images can be customized at runtime using EC2 User data
- But what if we could create our own image, ready to go?
- That’s an AMI – an image to use to create our instances
- AMIs can be built for Linux or Windows machines 

### Why you use a custom AMI?
- Using a custom built AMI can provide the following advantages:
  - Pre-installed packages needed
  - Faster boot time (no need for long ec2 user data at boot time
  - Machine comes configured with monitoring / enterprise software
  - Security concerns – control over the machines in the network
  - Control of maintenance and updates of AMIs over time
  - Active Directory Integration out of the box
  - Installing your app ahead of time (for faster deploys when auto-scaling)
  - Using someone else’s AMI that is optimized for running an app, DB, etc...
- **AMI are built for a specific AWS region (!)**

## EC2 Instances Overview
- Instances have 5 distinct characteristics advertised on the website:
  - The RAM(type,amount,generation)
  - The CPU(type,make,frequency,generation,numberofcores)
  - The I/O (disk performance, EBS optimisations)
  - The Network (network bandwidth, network latency
  - The Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) 
- It may be daunting to choose the right instance type (there are over 50 of them) - https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ 
- https://ec2instances.info/ can help with summarizing the types of instances 
- R/C/P/G/H/X/I/F/Z/CR are specialised in RAM, CPU, I/O, Network, GPU 
- M instance types are balanced 
- T2/T3 instance types are “burstable”
Burstable Instances (T2)
- AWS has the concept of burstable instances (T2 machines) 
- Burst means that overall, the instance has OK CPU performance. 
- When the machine needs to process something unexpected (a spike in load for example), it can burst, and CPU can be VERY good. 
- If the machine bursts, it utilizes “burst credits” 
- If all the credits are gone, the CPU becomes BAD 
- If the machine stops bursting, credits are accumulated over time
- Burstable instances can be amazing to handle unexpected traffic and getting the insurance that it will be handled correctly 
- If your instance consistently runs low on credit, you need to move to a different kind of non-burstable instance (all the ones described before). 

### T2 Unlimited 
- Nov 2017: It is possible to have an “unlimited burst credit balance
- You pay extra money if you go over your credit balance, but you don’t lose in performance
- Overall, it is a new offering, so be careful, costs could go high if you’re not monitoring the health of your instances
