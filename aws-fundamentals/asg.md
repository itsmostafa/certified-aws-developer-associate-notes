# ASG: Auto Scaling Group

In real-life, the load on your websites and applications can change. You can create and get rid of servers very quickly

The goal of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is to:
* Scale out (add EC2 Instances) to match an increased load
* Scale in (remove EC2 Instances) to match a decreased load
* Ensure we have a minimum and a maximum number of machines running
* Automatically register new instances to a load balancer

#### ASGs have the following attributes
* A launch configuration
    * AMI + Instance Type
    * EC2 User Data
    * EBS Volumes
    * Security Groups
    * SSH Key Pair
* Min Size / Max Size / Initial Capacity
* Network + Subnets Information
* Load Balancer Information
* Scaling Policies

#### Auto Scaling Alarms
* It is possible to scale an ASG based on CloudWatch alarms
* An alarm monitors a metric (such as Average CPU)
* Metrics are computed for the overall ASG instances
* Based on the alarm:
    * We can create a scale-out policies (increase the number of instances)
    * We can create a scale-in policies (decrease the number of instances)

#### New Auto Scaling Rules
* It is now possible to define “better” auto scaling rules that are directly managed by EC2
    * Target Average CPU Usage
    * Number of requests on the ELB per instance
    * Average Network In
    * Average Network Out
* These rules are easier to set up and can make more sense

#### Auto Scaling Custom Metric
* We can auto scale based on a custom metric (ex: number of connected users)
* 1. Send custom metrics from an application on EC2 to CloudWatch (PutMetric API)
* 2. Create a CloudWatch alarm to react to low / high values
* 3. Use the CloudWatch Alarm as the scaling policy for ASG

#### ASG Summary
* Scaling policies can be on CPU, Network… and can even be on custom metrics or based on a schedule (if you know your visitors patterns)
* ASGs use Launch configurations and you update an ASG by providing a new launch configuration
* IAM roles attached to an ASG will get assigned to EC2 instances
* ASG are free. You pay for the underlying resources being launched
* Having instances under an ASG means that if they get terminated for whatever reason, the ASG will restart them. Extra safety
* ASG can terminate instances marked as unhealthy by an LB (and hence replace them)
