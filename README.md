- EC2 + IAM Exam Checklist
  * Know how to SSH into EC2 (and change .pem file permissions) 
  * Know how to properly use security groups 
  * Know the fundamental differences between private vs public vs elastic IP 
  * Know how to use User Data to customize your instance at boot time 
  * Know that you can build custom AMI to enhance your OS 
  * EC2 instances are billed by the second and can be easily created and thrown away, welcome to the cloud!  
  Maybe on Exam:
  * Availability zones are in geographically isolated data centers
  * IAM users are NOT defined on a per-region basis
  * If you are getting a permission error exception when trying to SSH into your linux instance, then the key is missing chmod 400 permissions
  * If you are getting a network timeout when trying to SSH into your EC2 instance, then your security groups are misconfigured
  * Security groups reference IP address, CIDR block, Security group, but NOT DNS name
